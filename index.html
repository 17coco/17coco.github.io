              I was an active member and president of Guitar Association of
              Peking University. During my term, I promoted music education on
              campus, established connection with more than 3 major
              music-related student organiztions in PKU in order to build a
              network of musicians, and organized performances regularly, as
              well as performing on stage in different bands myself.

              I enjoy teaching people music and giving speeches and seminars

              knowledge of music and technology has been my long-time passion.
              My opinion on the relationship between art and tech is that all
              hardware and software including AI should be developed to help
              people create art but not to replace people in the creative
              process.
